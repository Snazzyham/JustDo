      "html": "<h2>An Experiment with React Native and styled-components</h2>\n<h3>Backstory</h3>\n<p>Yes, I know that building a to-do list app to test out a new framework or tool is a little overdone. In fact, <a href=\"https://medium.freecodecamp.com/every-time-you-build-a-to-do-list-app-a-puppy-dies-505b54637a5d\">there are many articles</a> where people argue about this said fact. </p>\n<p>So why <em><strong>did</strong></em> I build a todo app? Well, I used to use Wunderlist, but that had way too many features and I just got bored of it, so I switched to Trello. I really like using Trello for my bigger, project based tasks. However, I missed the simplicity of just being able to open up a todo list app and type stuff that needed to get done that day or the next day. </p>\n<p>Until I found BreakList. BreakList was great, it was clean, it didn&apos;t have logins, it just let you open up and start typing. It had some other stuff that I didn&apos;t use, such as a timer for tasks, and a separate list for breaks <em>(hence the name)</em>, but the UI was good enough such that even though I didn&apos;t use those features, they didn&apos;t get in the way. </p>\n<p>However, as an homage to Shakespearean drama, if it seems too good, it probably is. With BreakList, everytime I opened up the app from memory, adding a task would crash it. I contacted the developer, who apologised for it and told me that he hadn&apos;t updated it in a long time, and it didn&apos;t seem like he had any plans to update it any time soon. It&apos;s not his fault, it&apos;s a side project, you get busy with other things and you move on. That&apos;s what side projects are there for, to help you practice your skills. </p>\n<p>So anyway, I needed to learn React Native anyway for a work thing, and what better way then to build an app I actually need, even if it is a to-do list app. </p>\n<p>The UI of this app was heavily inspired by BreakList, with the colors being pretty much a direct ripoff from the <a href=\"https://spectrum.chat\">Spectrum team</a>. </p>\n<p>Here&apos;s what the app looks like:</p>\n<p><img src=\"./screenshot.gif\"> </p>\n<p>Here&apos;s what it does:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Add todos</li>\n<li>Mark as complete</li>\n<li>Long press to delete </li>\n<li>sort by active, complete or all</li>\n<li>persist state using <a href=\"https://github.com/jevakallio/redux-offline\">redux-offline</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>For now, the app isn&apos;t really available anywhere. If you want to try it out, you can find it on Expo (which is a little React Native app publishing platform) under <code>@snazzyham/justdo</code>. If you&apos;d like the APK hit me up on <a href=\"https://twitter.com/snazzyham\">twitter</a> or email me: snazzyham [at] gmail [dot] com. </p>\n"
