## An Experiment with React Native and styled-components


# WIP.

Adding these notes here so I remember;

- At the moment, the app can add new tasks, but they do not persist
- it is done in a very bad way. It modifies the state array. Need to do this in redux and then persist store.


aka

- convert state to store [x]
- be able to delete objects [ ]
- be able to view completed items [ ]
- persist store on device [ ]
