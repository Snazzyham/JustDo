## An Experiment with React Native and styled-components


# WIP.

Adding these notes here so I remember;

- ~~At the moment, the app can add new tasks, but they do not persist~~
- ~~it is done in a very bad way. It modifies the state array. Need to do this in redux and then persist store.~~


The app now lets you add tasks, mark as done, and persist store. If you'd like to try it out, you can either build it, add it on Expo where it can be found at `@snazzyham/justdo`, or by emailing me at snazzzyham [at] gmail [dot] com.


I still want to add filters for all, completed, active, as well as the option to delete todos.


aka

- convert state to store [x]
- be able to delete objects [ ]
- be able to view completed items [ ]
- persist store on device [x]
- add android multitasking theme and splash screen [ ]
